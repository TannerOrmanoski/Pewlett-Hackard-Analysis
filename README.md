# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of employees retiring for each title and identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Two tables will have to be created to display this info. This info will help the company Pewlett Hackard prepare for the upcoming “silver tsunami,” as many employees reach the retirement age. 


# Results

•	The first insight in the retiring_titles table is that the employees with the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff title will experience the largest exodus. The expected retirees in these groups far outnumber those in the other retiree groups.

•	Another observation is that half of the groups retiring have engineer titles. This means that Pewlett Hackard, should focus on hiring more engineers first and foremost. 



•	The last point of significance to be gathered from this table is that in total 72,458 employees are in the retiring age range.



•	From the mentorship_elegibility table the main point to look at is that there are 1,940 employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Summary 

1)	How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact?

There are 72,458 people within the retirement age range. If all these people leave the company, then presumably the same number of people will be needed to fill those roles.

2)	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

No, there are only 1,940 retirement age employees eligible to participate in this program, and there are 42, 803 roles that will need to be filled. That would mean that each mentor would have around 22 employees each to mentor.
